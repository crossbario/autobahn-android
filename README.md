Autobahn|Java is a subproject of the [Autobahn project](http://crossbar.io/autobahn/) and provides open-source client implementations for

* **[The WebSocket Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)**
* **[The Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)](http://wamp-proto.org/)**

running on Android and Netty/Java8/JVM.

The WebSocket layer is using a callback based user API, and is specifically written for Android. Eg it does not run any network stuff on the main (UI) thread.

The WAMP layer is using Java 8 **[CompletableFuture](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html)** for WAMP actions (call, register, publish and subscribe) and the **[Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)** for WAMP session, subscription and registration lifecycle events.

The library is MIT licensed, maintained by the Crossbar.io Project, tested using the AutobahnTestsuite and published as a JAR to Maven and as a Docker toolchain image to Dockerhub.

## Version 1

Version 1 of this library is still in the repo [here](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-java/tree/version-1), but is no longer maintained.

Version 1 only supported non-secure WebSocket on Android and only supported WAMP v1.

Both of these issues are fixed in the (current) version of Autobahn|Java.
